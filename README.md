# Retail store ELT pipeline project
## Project Overview: 
I designed and developed an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline for a retail store. The pipeline performs the following functions:
1. Data Collection:
OLTP Data: Data is extracted from the storeâ€™s OLTP database (RDS) and loaded into Snowflake using Airbyte. This process is scheduled to run daily.
S3 Data: Data is also collected from an S3 bucket and loaded into Snowflake using an AWS Lambda function. This Lambda function is orchestrated to run daily at 6 AM using Amazon EventBridge.
2. Data Transformation:
The data in Snowflake is transformed using dbt (Data Build Tool) to meet business requirements. The transformation models are scheduled to run using a cron job.
3. Data Visualization:
The transformed data is used to create visualizations in Metabase. Metabase is configured to refresh its data daily to ensure up-to-date reports and dashboards.
